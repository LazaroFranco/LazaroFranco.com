			<h4>Where am I today?</h4>I am a 20 year old student at <a href="http://stevenscollege.edu/">Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology</a>. I am currently studying a major that I have been passionate about learning since my freshman year in
			highschool at <a href="http://www.lapcs.org/">La Academia: The Partnership Charter School.</a>
			<h4>Highschool Experience</h4>I completed my freshman year at La Academia, however, I transferred to Mccaskey Highschool and ended up graduating from there with class of 2017. After transferring, I met with my school's counselor frequently and
			discussed my future plans for college. Since I was very interested in techonolgy, we both decided that it would be a good idea for me to join Mccaskey's Institute of Technology program. Throughout this program, I gained a lot of experience with
			all of the Microsoft Applications, such as Excel, Powerpoint, Word, Access, and etc. Unfortunately, I did not get to learn about coding in this program, but I ended up learning the basic features of it later on after joining the retail and
			hospitality workforces. <h4>Any activities on your free time?</h4>I enjoy going out shopping, playing sports with my freinds, playing video games and much more. Other then that I'm pretty much a workaholic, being in College has slowed that down
			though! <h4>Have you ever had a job??</h4>Yes BUT none of my jobs have yet been in the technology industry. I got hired at my first job at the age of 15 at Marshalls, which is a retail clothing store. I was only temporary there. I then moved on
			to Subway stayed there for a couple months gained some good customer service experience. Months after that I then got a job at Ollies Bargain outlet, worked there for about a year and half. By far it has been the best retail job and it also
			taught me that there's nothing wrong with having fun at work as long as succeding at what you're doing is what matters. After there i then went to go work at Wendys, Under Armour, last but not least now I'm working in the hotel industry. <h4>Now
				?</h4>Gaining experience from fast food, to retail and a side of contruction. I have noticed that I will not be doing that for the rest of my life. The main reason that we all go to college is to learn and have a career in something we love or
			have alot of passion for. I have chosen to be a Computer Software Engineer. As you saw throughout this website, I have only learned to use HTML and CSS to create websites. Which I'm pretty proud of at the moment!
